# Markdown Formatting Rules for Grammar Explanations

## Core Guidelines
1. Begin every grammar topic with a level-2 heading (##) that states the French name of the concept, e.g. `## Le pronom y`.
2. Use plain Markdown without decorative formatting. Bold text in French sentences should appear only when it highlights an essential element (such as the conjugated verb).
3. All examples must be bilingual: the French sentence first, followed immediately by its English translation.
4. Preserve all French accents and punctuation exactly as they appear.
5. End each grammar section with the following block, written exactly as shown:

<br>

---
---
<br>

6. Do not insert any blank lines unless they appear in the pattern above.

## Required Structure for Each Grammar Block

## [French name of the topic]

[A short and clear English explanation of the rule.]

**Examples :**
> [French example sentence]  
[English translation]

(Repeat this example pattern for each additional example or sub-rule.)

## Additional Formatting Instructions
- When the topic includes verb families or similar categories (e.g., *être*, *faire*, *avoir*), introduce each group with a level-3 heading (###).
- When the content requires lists (countries, connectors, prepositions), use hyphen lists or compact Markdown tables. Headers must be centered, and no extra blank lines should be added.
- If examples are taken from an image or contextual document, reproduce them using Markdown blockquotes.
- Always provide the English translation directly under each French example, without merging lines or leaving gaps.

## Example of Properly Formatted Block

## Le conditionnel pour exprimer le souhait

We use this structure to express **wishes**:  
**aimer (in the conditional) + verb in the infinitive**

| Sujet | aimer (présent) | aimer (conditionnel) |
|:-----:|:----------------:|:--------------------:|
| J’ | aime | aimerais |
| Tu | aimes | aimerais |
| Elle / il / on | aime | aimerait |
| Nous | aimons | aimerions |
| Vous | aimez | aimeriez |
| Elles / ils | aiment | aimeraient |

**Examples :**
> Est-ce que tu aimerais étudier à Montréal ?  
> Oui, j’aimerais étudier à Montréal !  
Would you like to study in Montreal?  
Yes, I would like to study in Montreal!
